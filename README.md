# DDOS Custom Merchs 

- # Project Proposal:
    -   There are already many competitors for Custom Merchs in the market, as one of the most important in fashion and design industry, and customized products come at a hefty price and one needs to physically visit boutiques and choose from thousands of designs and wait for weeks before it gets ready.
    -   To solve this problem and save time spent in visiting the stores and waiting while itâ€™s being made, my proposed solution is to design and deploy a website where anyone can easily select clothing material and color and graphic design and get it delivered all at a click on their device and in comparatively much less time.
